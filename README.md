## Inspiration:

 - Cloud to Butt chrome extension
 - Millennials to Snake People chrome extension

## You did what?
I shamelessly stole code from other chrome extensions, to make my own chrome extension, that does the following:
- Replaces occurrences of "Encryption" with "Magic".
- Replaces occurrences of "Encrypted" with "Enchanted"
- Replaces occurrences of "Encrypt" with "Bewitch"
